# Customer_Churn_Prediction

### About the project
Currently, ConnecTtel Telecom (a sample company) is having issues with customers retention strategies and precision leading to loss of valuable customers to competitors
The aim of this project is to analyze ConnecTtel customer's data to understand and build a robust prediction system to accurately forcast customer churn to overcome this challenge and improve retention strategies.

The above will be implemented with the approaches below:
  - Data Analysis
  - Machine Learning \
Conclusively, this model should be able to enhance customer loyalty, reduce customer attrition and maintain a competitive edge.

#### Phase One - Data Analysis
- Data Cleaning: The data was checked to be sure of it accuracy and consistency by checking for missing data, checking for duplicates, removing outliers, ensuring data consistency.
- Data Visualization: After the cleaning and data preparation, the data was visually represented to determine the correlation between different data and how it affects the churn rate of customers on Univariate analysis, bivariate analysis and multivariate analysis and the tools used are Seaborn and Matplotlib.

#### Phase Two - Machine Learning(Supervised Learning)
- Feature Engineering: This is transforming the data to make it usable for model building
- Understanding the key Feature importance for training the model by using Random forest classifier
- Split the data into test and train, where the model does not have an idea about the test data, it is only being trained
- Trained the model with Random Forest Classifier, logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifer and Gradient Booster classifier with their respective confusion matrix

### Recommendation
Organizations detest customer's churn. However, this is inevitable from the data above there seems to be an amount of customer churning at a certain rate and it will continue due to some certain factors:
- Create a loyalty scheme for customers with the first 23days for them to stay longer
- Incentivize Senior Citizens to make them stay longer on the platform
- Create discounts for customers paying high charges on total charges with one and two years contract to reduce churn rate
- More Information should be shared or given above Paperless Billings
